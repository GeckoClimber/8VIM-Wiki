# X-Board Basics

## The X-Board Structure
The x-board consists of a circle and four lines which are shaped like an X:
* The circle is called *“center”.*
* The lines are called *“borders”.*
* Center and borders divide the x-board into four additional areas called *“sectors”.*

## How to input a Letter or Character from the X-Board
Each character input on the x-board starts from the center to one of the sectors, crosses a specified number of borders and ends by going back from one sector to the center.
The drawn character depends on three factors:
* the starting sector,
* the direction of the movement, and
* the number of crossed borders before going back to the center.
