### Overall Concept
Getting started with 8Vim can be tough at first. Check out this YouTube video of 8Pen (the forerunner of 8Vim) to see how it works. The layout of 8Vim is a little different, but the concept is the same: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3OuCR0EpGo

### Sectors
Notice how the keyboard is divided in 4 sectors? If you tap once on a sector, these are the effects:

    Right Sector acts as a Backspace key
    Left Sector acts as a shortcut to the Number Pad
    Top Sector acts as a combo Shift & Caps Lock key (i.e, Press once for Shift, Press twice for Caps Lock, and Press once more and everything is back to usual)
    Bottom Sector acts as an Enter key

### Cursor Movements
If you move your finger from the center-circle to any sector and stay, the cursor will instead will move that direction. For example, if you swipe from circle->right, the cursor will move right. You get the picture.

Text selection is also built into the keyboard. If you move your finger from the right sector to the circle, it will switch to the copy/paste aspect of the keyboard (which includes cursor movement arrows).
